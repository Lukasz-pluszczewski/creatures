# Creatures
> Simulation of evolving creatures living in a 2d world and controlled by neural network brains.

### Setup
- Install dependencies in backend directory and run the app: `npm install && npm run dev`
- Install dependencies in visualization directory and run the app: `npm install && npm start`

### Notes
- Visualization app may not work on M1 mac. In that case [install x86 version of node](https://gist.github.com/LeZuse/bf838718ff2689c5fc035c5a6825a11c)
- Backend requires node version >= 17 (because of structuredClone function being used).
